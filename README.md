# Face-spoofing-detection-and-classification
This project is based on face spoofing detection and classification which can be used to check if any intruder is accessing an authorised personâ€™s privileges or access rights by using the latter's face photo or a video. For photo attack model, alternating layers of Conv2D with Relu activation function and maxpooling2D is used and sigmoid function is used for final classification. Accuracy: 100%. For video attack model, 10 frames from each video in the training dataset is taken and normalised. Various features (color spaces, blurriness, and chromatic difference) have been extracted to form the feature vector. Extra trees classifier is used for training. Accuracy: 81.1% Precision 83.275%.  Now for any given input, it is first tested for Liveness detection and reported if it is photo attack. Else, input is passed to video attack model. If it is video attack, it is reported else is reported as genuine.
